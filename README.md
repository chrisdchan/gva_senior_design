# Intro to Git Workshop

Version control is what it's all about

## GitHub and Git

### GitHub    -->  [browser]

GitHub is a **website** that allows you to upload your git respositories online. It allows you to have a backup of your files online, has a visual interface to navigate your repos, and it allows other people to be able to view, copy, or contribute to your repos.

### Git     --> [terminal]

Git is a **version control system**. It allows you to manage the history of your git repositories.
